## First Step 

Load the project to Visual studio and install all dependecies with

-npm install


## Second Step

I installed nodemon package and created a script. 

The project can be run using command:

-npm run dev

## Third Step

All details for the database can be found in /middleware folder under file dbConnection.js
I did not remove .env file, so the variables can be edited.
I also provide database for quick set up to run the project
